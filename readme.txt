Name of game: Calling for Caduceus

Developed by: Andrew Wernersbach, Milous Loche, Alan Koo, Keegan O'Neil

Narrative:
The never-ceasing war for supremacy between the divine, demonic and the heroic faction continues to rage on. Each side is seeking something to turn the tides to their favor using any means necessary. A flame lit under the factions as the divine discovered an ancient stone tablet describing Caduceus a weapon of unlimited power. The only thing able to be derived from the cryptic tablet is that the Caduceus, which is wielded by a being of great power, lies far outside the realm of our everyday life in a place that can only be accessed by a means of travel dubbed the “void link”. You awake to find your partner tending to you after you passed out. They begin to brief you that the guardians of heaven are still roaming the earth causing turmoil and that you must take to the sky to defeat them.

Instructions:
To start your journey, type ‘source intro.sh’. Throughout the game, you will be prompted to type ‘cd <area_name>’ to enter a new area and each time, you will type ‘source intro.sh’ afterwards to look around the area. In between intro and combat, you may take a look at your stats or your enemy’s stats by typing ‘cat $my_stats’ or ‘cat $enemy_stats’. To see a move’s stats, type ‘cat $moves | grep <move_name>’. There may be reminders or indicators of when to use these tools, or other tools along the way, so be on the lookout. Be sure to experience both endings :)
