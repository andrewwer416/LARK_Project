echo -e "$team_name: Unlike other places we have visited, a battle will begin with the command 'source battle.sh'. \
To help you prepare for the battle, you can do a quick check of your \
stats. To check your stats, you can use the command 'cat \$my_stats'. This will display a list \
of your name, hitpoints, and attacks. Luckily, you can just as easily view your enemy's stats \
with 'cat \$enemy_stats'. Oh and I guess just knowing the name of a move won't do you much good... \
Similar to displaying stats, you can display a move's damage, accuracy and description by using \
'cat \$moves | grep move_name'. The grep command will help you locate your move in the logbook of known moves. \
Pretty convenient huh? Be sure to try these out before your first battle. For this first one, \
you'll be up against me. Believe me, I don't plan on going easy on you, even if your head is fuzzy."
