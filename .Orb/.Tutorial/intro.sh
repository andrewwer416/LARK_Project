echo -e "${BLUE}$team_name${NC}: To help you prepare for a battle, you can always do a quick check of your \
stats. To do this, you can type 'cat \$my_stats'. This will display a list \
of your name, hitpoints, and attacks. If you forget to do this before combat, \
you can always check during a fight by pressing 5. Luckily, you can just as easily view your enemy's stats by \
typing 'cat \$enemy_stats'. Oh and I guess just knowing the name of a move won't do you much good... \
Similar to displaying stats, you can display a move's damage, accuracy and description by typing \
'cat \$moves | grep move_name'. The grep command will help you locate your move in the logbook of known moves. \
Pretty convenient huh? Be sure to try these out before your first battle. For this first one, \
you'll be up against me. Believe me, I don't plan on going easy on you, even if your head is fuzzy. \
Type 'source battle.sh' when you are ready to begin."
