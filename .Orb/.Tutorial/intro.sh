stats. To check your stats, you can use the command 'cat \$my_stats'. This will display a list\
of your name, hitpoints, attacks, and their corresponding damages. Luckily, you can just as easily view your enemy's stats\
with 'cat \$enemy_stats'. Pretty convenient huh? Be sure to try it before this battle. After all, for this first one,\
you'll be up against me, and I won't go easy on you, even if your head is still fuzzy."
